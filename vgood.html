							 AI is quite good at caring for and entertaining old lonely people and people in need.<br>
							 I want to see AI planting trees. <br>
							 It`s quite good at educating us. <br>
							 Well, yes, AI can write email for you. But what about improving the human condition ? <br>
							 It should help us in politics, since it is something humans seem to constantly fail at. <br>
							 AI should go cleaning the ocean. <br>
							 There is nothing it can help us in, sorry.<br>
                             It could help in the survival of the human species . <br>
							 AI should help us to answer to “is there a god” ?<br>
							 It should definitely educate and broaden peoples horizons. <br>
							 AI shall keep the progress in medecine, and healthcare. It should help people with disabilities too.<br>
							 In terms of safety, it can improve our lifes quite a lot. <br>
							 AI could boost science, and research. <br>
							 AI could stop traffic jams. <br>
							 AI could stop traffic jams. <br>
							 AI could take care of ignorant people. <br>
							 What about AI-powered smart cops that dont beat people and shoot on sight? <br>
							 AI can alert if there is a burglar in your neighborhood. <br>
							 AI could explain to some people that certain behaviors are not acceptable, and suggest them to apologize or change thei way of doing. <br>
							 If it fits with an inclusive idea of society, AI could be used everywhere.  AI would have a low error rate compared to humans, if coded properly.  <br>
							 I want it to debunk all the fake news, misleading ads, fake promises of politicians, etc.<br>
							 AI has to look towards wealth inequality, discriminations, and corruption prevention. <br>
							 What about developping more sustainable ways of producing, consuming and managing the ressources of the planet efficiently?<br>
							 It is great at reducing repetitive, alienating or hard labors.<br>
							 It could strengthen empathy to result in better decision-making.<br>
							 It should help us find a way out of capitalism. <br>
