							   Coming soon: a report around the collected individual perspectives
                                 on which spaces these new technologies should not inhabit or not prevail,
                                 and the reasons which motivated such safeguards. Below is a vaporous glimpse
                                 on some responses. <br>
                                 <br>

                             Please AI, do whatever you want here, but please don`t start cooking. <br>
							 It should not invade intimate matters, prostitution or sexual content. <br>
							 Well, it seems AI should not drive cars. <br>
							 Emotional support definitely seems like something that living things should do.<br>
							 Spare education from AI, as human relations are fundamental here. <br>
							 I hope AI would not touch anything that involve "sensations", like food, politics, justice, education and sex.<br>
							 AI should not influence our way to experience the time. <br>
							 It should stay away from the things belonging to the sphere of the human thought: Education, Politics, Art. <br>
                             Well, in an inclusive idea of society, I would use it everywhere. <br>
							 It should not rule politics. <br>
							 AI should not be used to identify people in their everyday Life, nor to sort people in their categories. <br>
							 AI must stay away from everything justice/control related or what supposes the recognition of a context
							  and multiple factors. <br>
								AI could not replace human contact or sharing of cultures. The sharing of life experiences are valuable in person.<br>
								I am afraid AI would make human inconsistent. <br>
								I do not want to see AI producing even more individulised motored traffic in streets. . <br>
							 It must not be used when it leads to a more uniformed and normative society. <br>
							 It should go nowhere where I canÂ´t make the final decision.<br>
							 Perhaps, Art. <br>
							 AI should not pretend play the role of human ressources, because AIs do not yet have the capacity to select personnel subjectively. <br>
							 AI should not adventure on areas that involve chance encounters.<br>
							 Man is most dangerous with things he does not understand. Giving up control would be irresponsible.<br>
							 AI should not try to surpass human.<br>
							 I wish AI stay away from testing on humans or animals that put the physical integrity of both of them at risk. <br>
							 Education, media and politics seems to me quite sad use of AI. <br>
							 AI should not try to make money, or put people out of jobs. <br>
							 Fields such as education, politics, social, or communication need direct, personal human involvement. They need to be permeable to the human sphere of feelings:
							 weakness, compassion, joy, empathy, etc.  <br>
							 I do not believe that there is an area in which they should not be used but I do believe that there are many situations in which they still cannot be used
							 due to the current limitations.<br>
							 In all what could hurt the general happiness or serenity.<br>
							 For sex, common, that`s so sad.<br>
